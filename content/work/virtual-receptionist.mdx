## The Problem

Traditional reception workflows are expensive, inconsistent, and hard to scale. Businesses with multiple
locations struggle to maintain uniform visitor experiences while meeting security and compliance requirements.

Manual sign-in sheets are unreliable, host notifications are delayed, and there's no centralised audit trail.

## Our Solution

We built **Virtual Receptionist** — a complete visitor management system that replaces the traditional
front desk with an intelligent, self-serve kiosk experience.

### How It Works

1. **Visitor arrives** and interacts with a tablet-based kiosk
2. **Self-serve check-in** with name, company, and purpose of visit
3. **Host notification** sent instantly via email and push notification
4. **Badge printing** triggered automatically with visitor details
5. **Audit log** maintained with timestamps and host confirmations

### AI-Powered Features

- **Pre-registration:** Hosts can pre-register expected visitors, enabling one-tap check-in
- **Repeat visitor recognition:** Returning visitors get a streamlined experience
- **Anomaly detection:** System flags unexpected or after-hours visitors
- **Natural language:** Visitors can type or speak their purpose of visit

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native (tablet kiosk), Next.js (admin dashboard)
- **Backend:** Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **AI:** Custom NLP model for visit purpose classification
- **Hardware:** iPad kiosk, thermal badge printer
- **Hosting:** AWS (ECS + RDS)

## Results

- **85% reduction** in front-desk staffing requirements
- **30-second average** check-in time (down from 3+ minutes)
- **100% compliance** with visitor logging and audit requirements
- **3 locations** deployed and running simultaneously
