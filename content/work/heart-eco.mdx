## The Problem

Professor Khurshid Ahmad's research team at a leading UK university needed a private, secure AI assistant
that could interrogate decades of environmental sustainability data. The key challenge: the AI had to
**strictly use provided datasets**, refuse external knowledge, and handle year-range validation — no
hallucinations allowed.

Existing tools like ChatGPT couldn't guarantee data grounding, and commercial analytics platforms
lacked the specificity needed for HEART metrics (HV, HAV, HAR, HS).

## Our Solution

We built **Heart‑Eco AI** — a fully local, RAG-powered AI assistant with strict guardrails.

### Data Ingestion Pipeline
- Custom pipeline to ingest CSV, Excel, and PDF datasets spanning 15+ years
- Semantic chunking with metadata preservation for year and metric type
- Vector embeddings stored in a local vector database for fast retrieval

### AI Agent Layer
- RAG architecture ensuring every response cites source data
- Strict refusal for out-of-range years — the AI won't guess
- Stored scores used directly; derived analytics computed only on demand
- Sources hidden by default, shown only when explicitly requested

### Interactive Frontend
- Next.js dashboard with Recharts for trend visualisation
- TanStack Table for sortable, filterable data exploration
- Flourish story embed for presentation-ready narratives
- Dark-themed UI matching the research team's preferences

### Security & Privacy
- Entire system runs locally — no data leaves the institution
- Basic access control for research team members
- Guardrails against destructive commands

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, RAG pipeline
- **AI:** Custom retrieval model with strict grounding
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, TanStack Table
- **Data:** Vector database, pandas, custom ingestion scripts
- **Deployment:** On-premise (university infrastructure)

## Results

- **100% data-grounded** responses — zero hallucination in testing
- **15+ years** of HEART metric data ingested and queryable
- **Interactive dashboards** with publication-ready visualisations
- **4-week MVP** delivery from first meeting to production
- **Full privacy** — all data stays on-premise
