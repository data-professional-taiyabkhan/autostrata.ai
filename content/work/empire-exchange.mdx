## The Problem

Empire Exchange was a brand-new business that needed to get online fast. They had no existing web presence
and needed a professional platform that could handle customer enquiries, bookings, and clearly communicate
their services — all within a tight timeline and budget.

Off-the-shelf templates wouldn't cut it. They needed something that felt bespoke but could be delivered at speed.

## Our Solution

We built a custom web application from scratch using a modern stack optimised for performance and
developer experience. The entire project — from discovery to deployment — was completed in just two weeks.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Mobile-first:** Over 70% of their target audience browses on mobile, so we designed for phones first
  and scaled up to desktop.
- **Performance-obsessed:** Static generation, optimised images, and minimal JavaScript for sub-2-second
  load times.
- **Self-service admin:** Content can be updated without developer involvement.

### Features Delivered

- Responsive landing page with clear service descriptions
- Integrated enquiry form with email notifications
- Booking system with calendar integration
- SEO-optimised pages with structured data
- Analytics dashboard integration

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Forms:** Formspree
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4

## Results

- **2-week delivery** — from first call to production
- **95+ Lighthouse score** across all metrics
- **Integrated booking system** reducing manual back-and-forth
- **Zero downtime** since launch day
