## The Problem

Sartorial London operates a premium fashion marketplace built on Sharetribe. Despite offering curated, high-quality
pieces, their landing page wasn't converting visitors into buyers. The existing layout lacked visual hierarchy, the
product discovery experience was fragmented, and key conversion touchpoints were buried below the fold.

Their team needed a fast turnaround — a redesign that could be shipped in weeks, not months.

## Our Solution

We rebuilt the landing page from the ground up while preserving their Sharetribe infrastructure. Our approach focused
on three pillars:

### 1. Visual Hierarchy Overhaul
We restructured the page layout to lead with lifestyle imagery, followed by curated collections and a
clear value proposition. Every section was designed to guide users toward browsing and checkout.

### 2. Featured Fits Section
We designed and implemented a custom **"Featured Fits"** section — a curated grid of styled outfits that
links directly to individual products. This gave shoppers outfit inspiration while reducing friction to purchase.

### 3. Workflow Integration
We integrated Sharetribe's API with their existing CRM and email marketing tools, automating post-purchase
follow-ups and enabling personalised product recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **Platform:** Sharetribe Flex
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Integrations:** Sharetribe API, Mailchimp, Google Analytics 4
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Results

The numbers speak for themselves:

- **40% increase** in browse-to-checkout conversion within the first month
- **1.8s page load** (down from 4.2s)
- **25% more product discovery** via the Featured Fits section
- **3-week delivery** from initial discovery call to production launch
