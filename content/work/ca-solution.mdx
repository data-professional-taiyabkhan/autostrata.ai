## The Problem

C&A Solution is a professional services firm that was drowning in manual admin work. Invoice generation,
client data management, and weekly reporting were all handled through spreadsheets and email chains.
As the company grew, these manual processes became a bottleneck — errors crept in, reports were late,
and the admin team was spending more time on data entry than client-facing work.

They needed automation that could integrate with their existing tools without disrupting day-to-day operations.

## Our Solution

We designed and built a comprehensive automation suite that connected their existing tools into a
seamless workflow.

### Invoice Automation

- Template system for different service types and payment terms
- Auto-send with configurable schedules and reminders
- Integration with accounting software for reconciliation

### CRM Integration
- Connected their client management system with email and project tools
- Automated lead capture and qualification workflows
- Client lifecycle tracking with automated follow-ups
- Centralised contact database replacing scattered spreadsheets

### Reporting Dashboard
- Real-time KPI dashboard for leadership team
- Automated weekly and monthly report generation
- Revenue forecasting based on pipeline data
- Team utilisation and capacity tracking

### Workflow Orchestration
