## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous software systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and
take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional rule-based automation, AI agents can
handle ambiguity, learn from interactions, and adapt to new situations.

## What We Build

### Customer Support Agents
Intelligent chatbots that understand context, access your knowledge base, and resolve
customer enquiries without human intervention. When they can't help, they escalate
seamlessly with full context.

### Sales & Lead Qualification Agents
AI systems that engage with prospects, qualify leads based on your criteria, and route
high-value opportunities to your sales team.

### Research & Knowledge Management Agents
Tools that summarise documents, answer questions from your knowledge base, and help
teams find information faster.

### Multi-Agent Systems
Complex workflows where multiple AI agents collaborate — one handles research,
another drafts content, a third reviews quality.

## Our Approach

1. **Discover** — We map your workflows and identify the highest-impact automation opportunities
2. **Prototype** — We build a working agent in 1–2 weeks for testing with real users
3. **Refine** — Based on feedback, we tune the agent's behaviour and expand its capabilities
4. **Deploy** — Production deployment with monitoring, logging, and escalation paths

## Tech Stack

We use the best tools for each project:

- **LLM providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models
- **Frameworks:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom orchestration
- **Vector stores:** Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector
- **Deployment:** AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premise
