## The Document Problem

Every business drowns in documents. Invoices, contracts, applications, compliance forms —
all containing critical data that needs to be extracted, validated, and entered into systems.
Manual processing is slow, expensive, and error-prone.

## What Is Intelligent Document Processing?

IDP uses AI to understand, extract, and process information from documents automatically.
Unlike traditional OCR, IDP understands context, handles variations in formatting, and
can make intelligent decisions about the data it extracts.

## Capabilities

### Document Classification
Automatically identify document types — invoice, contract, ID document, application form —
and route them to the appropriate workflow.

### Data Extraction
Pull structured data from unstructured documents: names, dates, amounts, line items,
clauses, and more. Works across different formats and layouts.

### Validation & Enrichment
Cross-reference extracted data against your existing systems. Flag discrepancies,
auto-correct common errors, and enrich records with additional context.

### Workflow Integration
Extracted data flows directly into your existing systems — ERP, CRM, accounting
software — without manual intervention.

## Use Cases

- **Invoice processing:** Extract line items, amounts, and vendor details automatically
- **Contract analysis:** Identify key clauses, dates, and obligations across hundreds of contracts
- **KYC/AML compliance:** Process identity documents and verify against watchlists
- **Insurance claims:** Extract claim details from forms, photos, and correspondence
- **HR onboarding:** Process employment documents, certificates, and right-to-work checks

## Technology

- **OCR engines:** Tesseract, AWS Textract, Azure Form Recognizer
- **AI models:** Custom extraction models, GPT-4 for complex understanding
- **Integration:** REST APIs, webhooks, file watchers
- **Deployment:** Cloud or on-premise, depending on data sensitivity
