## Cheap Isn't Always Affordable

Offshore development can seem like a no-brainer: lower hourly rates, larger talent pools,
24/7 coverage. But the hidden costs often erode any savings.

## The Hidden Costs

### Communication Overhead
Timezone differences of 5–10 hours mean asynchronous communication becomes the norm. What
could be resolved in a 10-minute conversation becomes a 24-hour email thread.

### Quality Rework
Lower rates often correlate with less experienced developers. The cost of fixing issues,
refactoring poorly structured code, and managing technical debt adds up quickly.

### Security and Compliance
GDPR compliance, data residency requirements, and intellectual property protection become
significantly more complex with offshore teams.

### Management Tax
Someone on your team needs to manage the offshore relationship. That's time your senior
people aren't spending on strategy or product development.

## The Alternative

Work with a local team that uses AI to multiply their output. You get:

- **Same timezone** — real-time collaboration
- **Higher quality** — experienced engineers who understand your market
- **AI-augmented delivery** — competitive pricing through automation, not cheap labour
- **Accountability** — a team that's invested in the UK business ecosystem
