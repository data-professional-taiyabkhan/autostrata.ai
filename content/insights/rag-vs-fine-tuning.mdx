## Two Paths, One Goal

When building an AI system that needs domain-specific knowledge, you have two main approaches:
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **fine-tuning**. Both have their place, but choosing
the wrong one can cost you months and thousands of pounds.

## RAG: Connect AI to Your Data

RAG works by retrieving relevant documents from your knowledge base and feeding them to the AI
model as context. The model itself doesn't change — it just gets better context.

**Best for:**
- Frequently updated knowledge bases
- Compliance-sensitive industries (you control what the AI sees)
- Projects where you need to cite sources
- Quick implementation (days, not weeks)

## Fine-Tuning: Teach the Model Directly

Fine-tuning modifies the model's weights using your training data. The model "learns" your
domain at a fundamental level.

**Best for:**
- Consistent, well-defined tasks (classification, extraction)
- When you need specific output formats
- High-volume, low-latency applications
- When your domain language is very specialised

## Our Recommendation

For most business applications, **start with RAG**. It's faster to implement, easier to maintain,
and gives you more control over the AI's behaviour. Only move to fine-tuning when RAG hits its limits.
