## Why Data Viz Matters on LinkedIn

LinkedIn rewards content that stops the scroll. Walls of text don't cut it anymore — but a
well-crafted data visualisation tells a story in seconds. At AutoStrata, we combine
**Matplotlib** for analytical accuracy with **Canva** for design polish.

## Our Process

### Step 1: Analytical Visuals with Matplotlib
We start with the data. Using Python and Matplotlib, we generate:

- **Trend lines** showing performance over time
- **Share-of-attempt charts** comparing effort vs. outcome
- **FG% by zone** heatmaps for spatial analysis
- **Correlation plots** revealing hidden relationships

The key is making the chart *readable* — clear labels, sensible axis ranges, and a
colour palette that works on mobile screens.

### Step 2: Design Polish with Canva
Raw Matplotlib charts are accurate but not scroll-stopping. We take the exported charts
into Canva to add:

- **Brand colours and typography** for consistency
- **Callout boxes** highlighting key takeaways
- **One-page infographic layouts** for LinkedIn carousel posts
- **Mobile-optimised sizing** (1080×1350 for feed posts)

### Step 3: Narrative Structure
Every visualisation needs a story. We structure LinkedIn posts as:

1. **Hook** — a surprising stat or question
2. **Context** — what the data shows and why it matters
3. **Insight** — the non-obvious takeaway
4. **CTA** — what the reader should do next

## Example Output

For a recent project, we produced a one-page infographic poster combining:
- Three trend-line charts tracking KPIs over 12 months
- A share-of-attempt breakdown by channel
- Key metrics called out in large, bold numbers
- A QR code linking to the full interactive dashboard

The post generated **3x the average engagement** compared to text-only updates.
