## Is Manual Work Holding You Back?

Not every process needs automation. But some absolutely do. Here are five signs it's time to automate.

## 1. Your Team Is Doing the Same Task More Than 10 Times a Day

If a task is repetitive, rule-based, and high-volume, it's a prime automation candidate. Think:
data entry, invoice processing, email routing, status updates.

## 2. Errors Are Costing You Money

Human errors in manual processes are inevitable. If mistakes lead to financial loss, compliance
issues, or customer complaints, automation removes the risk.

## 3. You're Scaling But Not Hiring

Growth without proportional headcount means automation is essential. The right workflows can
10x your output without adding a single team member.

## 4. Information Lives in Silos

When team members spend time copying data between systems — CRM to spreadsheet, email to
project management tool — that's integration work that should be automated.

## 5. Response Times Are Slipping

If customers or internal stakeholders are waiting longer for responses, it's often because
manual processes can't keep up with demand.

## What to Do About It

Start with a process audit. Map your workflows, identify bottlenecks, and prioritise the
highest-impact automations first.
