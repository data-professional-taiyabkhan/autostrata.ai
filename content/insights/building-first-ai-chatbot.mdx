## Before You Build

AI chatbots are one of the most requested projects we see. But there's a big difference between
a demo and a production chatbot. Here's what you need to know before you start.

## Step 1: Define the Scope

Don't try to build a chatbot that "does everything." Start with a specific use case:

- **Customer FAQ** — Answer common questions from your knowledge base
- **Lead qualification** — Collect and score information from prospects
- **Appointment booking** — Guide users to schedule meetings
- **Product recommendations** — Help customers find the right product

## Step 2: Choose Your Approach

- **Rule-based:** For simple, predictable flows (forms, menus)
- **RAG-powered:** For knowledge base Q&A with natural language
- **Fine-tuned:** For highly specialised domains with unique terminology

## Step 3: Data Preparation

Your chatbot is only as good as its data. You'll need:

- A clean, up-to-date knowledge base
- Example conversations for testing
- Clear escalation rules (when to hand off to a human)

## Step 4: Build and Test

- Start with an MVP that handles your top 10 questions
- Test with real users, not just your team
- Monitor conversations and iterate weekly

## Step 5: Deploy and Monitor

- Set up conversation logging (with privacy compliance)
- Track satisfaction scores and resolution rates
- Plan for ongoing maintenance and knowledge updates
