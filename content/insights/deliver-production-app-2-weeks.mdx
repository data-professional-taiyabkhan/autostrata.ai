## Speed Without Compromise

When Empire Exchange approached us, they needed a professional web presence — fast. We delivered
a production-ready application in just two weeks. Here's how.

## The Secret: Opinionated Defaults

We don't start from zero. Our stack is battle-tested:

- **Next.js** for the framework (static generation, API routes, everything in one place)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (no design system debates)
- **Vercel** for hosting (zero-config deploys)
- **Formspree** for forms (no backend needed)

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

- **Days 1–2:** Discovery call, scope document, design system setup
- **Days 3–5:** Core pages built and reviewed
- **Days 6–8:** Interactions, forms, and integrations
- **Days 9–10:** Testing, accessibility audit, performance optimisation
- **Days 11–12:** Client review and refinements
- **Days 13–14:** Launch, monitoring, and documentation

## What Makes This Possible

1. **AI-assisted development** — We use AI tools to accelerate boilerplate and testing
2. **Reusable components** — Our component library means less custom code
3. **Clear scope** — We agree on deliverables upfront, no scope creep
