## The Toolchain Behind Smart Content

At AutoStrata, we don't guess what content to create — we let the data decide. By combining
**Supermetrics**, **Dataslayer**, and **Meta Analytics**, we've built a workflow that turns raw
social media data into actionable content recommendations.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
Supermetrics pulls data from Meta (Facebook + Instagram), LinkedIn, and Google Ads into a
centralised Google Sheet. Dataslayer automates the refresh schedule, so the data is always
current without manual exports.

### 2. Trend Detection
We analyse the data for patterns:
- Which content formats get the most engagement?
- What posting times drive the highest reach?
- Which topics have rising share-of-voice?
- Where are competitors gaining traction?

### 3. Automated Suggestions
Based on the trends, we generate content briefs automatically. These include:
- **Topic recommendations** based on rising interest
- **Format suggestions** (carousel, video, single image) based on engagement data
- **Timing recommendations** for optimal posting windows
- **Hashtag analysis** for maximum organic reach

## Real Results

For one client, this approach delivered:
- **35% increase** in organic engagement within 8 weeks
- **2x faster** content planning cycles
- **Data-backed decisions** replacing gut-feel guesses

## Why This Matters

Most social media management is reactive — you post, check the numbers, and adjust. By
front-loading analytics into the planning phase, you make every post count from day one.
